## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict student performance (e.g., exam scores). The goal is to help educators and students understand key factors affecting academic outcomes and identify students who may need additional support.

Student performance prediction is a common ML problem where models analyze factors like study time, parental education, and previous scores to estimate outcomes. ([GitHub][1])
